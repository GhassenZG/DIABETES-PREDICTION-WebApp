# Diabetes-Prediction-WebApp
 
Diabetes Prediction Web App is an AI-powered application I developed during my university years that allows users to input key health metrics to determine their diabetes risk. Utilizing Python and machine learning techniques, the app analyzes the data and provides users with insights and assessments, aiding in early detection and prevention of diabetes. Ideal for healthcare professionals and patients. I wanted to make a mini virtual doctor for diabetes :)
